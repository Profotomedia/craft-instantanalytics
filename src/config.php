 * Instant Analytics config.php

 * Completely optional configuration settings for Instant Analytics if you want
 * to customize some of its more esoteric behavior, or just want specific control
 * over things.
 *
 * Don't edit this file, instead copy it to 'craft/config' as
 * 'instantanalytics.php' and make your changes there.
 *
 * Once copied to 'craft/config', this file will be multi-environment aware as
 * well, so you can have different settings groups for each environment, just as
 * you do for 'general.php'
